we can private all intermidiate api. right now it is open and does not require 
the authentication.

Since Homecenery is restricated to use and it charges(i assume). we can stored
the result to our database for future use and avoid the api call to homecenery.
it has two benefines 

1) we can aviod unneccary charges for same api call.
2) we also can reduce a letency and make our app faster.

As requirments grows we can also release the api version right now its v1

All the Security like SSL certificate, authentication, authoration which 
is not related to business logic we can configure all those component using API gateway
that way our business logic and extra component will be easy to maintain. 

finally we also can document out api with good example and tutorial which is Eventually helpful 
who is joinin a team and support team or any another team member who is not involving in 
development process.
